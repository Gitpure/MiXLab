# Status for now
I'm really sorry for not responding to the open issues, or some that I responded but didn't close.<br>
(I got distracted with other hobbies like gaming, interesting youtube channels and other stuff lol.)<br>
Anyway, since I don't use the notebook as often as before, I don't really have any plan to update it. If it is still working, then that's good.
