# Update (as of 2022-07-07)
So, it seems Google has flagged my Notebook.  
I can't run some number of cells (other than the broken tunneling (Argo Tunnel, localhost, ngrok)).  
For example, the Chrome Remote Desktop.

Colab is now basically telling:  
"Hey! You can't run that! That's not what Colab is for!"  
"Well... if you still want/insist to run it, go ahead. BUT! we'll be flagging your account as well."

# How to use
Click <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/shirooo39/MiXLab/blob/master/MiXLab.ipynb" target="_blank">HERE</a> for the "Standard" version.  
Click <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/shirooo39/MiXLab/blob/master/MiXLabLite.ipynb" target="_blank">HERE</a> for the "Lite" version.  
(haven't been updated for quite a long time, but should still work just fine.)
